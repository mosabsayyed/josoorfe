<h1>Episode 2.4: Organizational Design</h1>





<div>

<h2>Introduction: From &quot;How&quot; to
&quot;Who&quot; </h2>

</div>

<p>In our journey so far, we have cascaded strategy into measurable
KPIs, aligned those KPIs with a portfolio of initiatives, and anchored all work
in a defined process architecture. We have answered &quot;why,&quot;
&quot;what,&quot; and &quot;how.&quot; We now address the most critical
question for execution: <strong>&quot;Who?&quot; </strong></p>

<p>Organizational structure is far more than a chart of
reporting lines; it is the backbone of accountability. In a transformation, its
purpose is to ensure that every strategic outcome, every leading KPI, and every
executable process has a clear and unambiguous owner. When structure is
unclear, static, or disconnected from the real work,
accountability evaporates, decision-making stalls, and the transformation loses
momentum. </p>

<div>

<h2>The Four-Level Cascade of
Accountability </h2>

</div>

<p>Just as with KPIs and processes, the organizational
structure must be viewed as a cascaded hierarchy. Each level has a distinct
role in owning a specific layer of performance, creating a clear line of sight
from the executive suite to the front line. </p>

<h2>Dynamic Structure </h2>

</div>

<p>In a transformation context, a static org chart is a
liability. As the organization builds new capabilities and re-engineers its
processes, the structure must adapt in response. Roles will be created , merged, or evolved. </p>

<p>Therefore, the organizational structure should be treated
as a dynamic, living modela core component of the
transformation architecture itself. This requires a proactive approach: </p>

<ul>
 <li>Map Roles to Processes: Every L3 process must be
     explicitly mapped to a role (Owner, Performer, Approver).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Treat Vacancies as Risks: A vacant role is not just
     an HR issue; it is a criticalcapability gap. It
     represents a break in the accountability chain and introduces predictable
     risk to every process and KPI that depends on that role. This risk must be
     flagged in the transformation governance forum.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Plan Structural Evolution: The future-state
     organizational design is a key deliverable of the
     transformation and must be planned and managed like any other initiative.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach shifts the culture from a rigid bureaucracy
to an agile entity, where the structure is designed to serve the strategy, not
the other way around. </p>

<div>

<h2>The Horizontal Dimension </h2>

</div>

<p>While the vertical cascade creates top-to-bottom
alignment, the <strong>horizontal cascade </strong>uses structure to break down silos. A leading KPI at the L2 Main Unit level
is often the sum of multiple operational KPIs owned by different L3 Sub-Units. </p>

<p>For example, the &quot;Average Permit Approval Time&quot;
(L2 KPI) for a department depends on the performance of the Application
Processing team, the Inspection team, and the Legal Review team. The
architectural model makes this shared dependency explicit. No single sub-unit
can succeed in isolation; they are structurally bound to collaborate to achieve
the collective goal. </p>

<div>

<h2>Key Takeaways </h2>

</div>

<ul>
 <li>An organization's structure must be designed as a
     map ofaccountability,
     directly linking people to processes and KPIs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Accountability cascades through four levels, from
     the Entity Head owning strategic KPIs down to individuals owning process
     metrics.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>In a transformation, the structure must bedynamic, and a vacant role must be treated as a criticalriskto performance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>The structure must be designed to enforcehorizontal collaboration, breaking down silos
     by making shared KPI dependencies transparent.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>This accountability framework is a critical layer of
     theDigital Twin, allowing leaders to manage
     human capital risk and performance with data-driven precision.</li>
</ul>

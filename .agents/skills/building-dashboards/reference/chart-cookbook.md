# Chart Cookbook

Detailed APL patterns for each chart type with real-world examples.

> **Note:** Dashboard panel queries inherit time from the UI picker—no explicit `_time` filter needed. The examples below show ad-hoc query patterns with time filters for testing in the Query tab. Remove the `where _time between (...)` line when using these in dashboards.

## Statistic

Single-value panels for KPIs and current state.

### Error Rate (Percentage)
```apl
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(5m) .. now())
| where service == "api-gateway"
| summarize 
    total = count(),
    errors = countif(status >= 500)
| extend error_rate = round(100.0 * errors / total, 2)
| project error_rate
```

### Current p95 Latency
```apl
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(5m) .. now())
| where service == "api-gateway"
| summarize p95 = percentile(duration_ms, 95)
```

### Request Rate (per second)
```apl
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(5m) .. now())
| where service == "api-gateway"
| summarize requests = count()
| extend rps = round(requests / 300.0, 1)  // 300 seconds = 5 min

```

### Active Errors (count)
```apl
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(5m) .. now())

    last_5m = countif(_time >= ago(5m) and status >= 500),
    prev_55m = countif(_time < ago(5m) and status >= 500)
| extend change_pct = round(100.0 * (last_5m - prev_55m/11) / (prev_55m/11 + 0.001), 1)

## SmartFilter

No APL needed—configure these fields for interactive filtering:

### Recommended Filter Fields
- `service` — Which service to focus on
- `environment` — prod/staging/dev
- `region` — Geographic region
- `route` — API endpoint
- `status` — HTTP status code
- `customer_id` — For multi-tenant systems
- `kubernetes.namespace` — K8s namespace
- `kubernetes.pod.name` — Specific pod

### Configuration Tips
- Place SmartFilter at top of dashboard
- Include 3–5 most useful filter dimensions
- Avoid high-cardinality fields as primary filters (trace_id, request_id)

## Filter Bar

Interactive filters for dashboard-wide filtering.

```apl
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(1h) .. now())
| distinct ['geo.country']
| project key=['geo.country'], value=['geo.country']
| sort by key asc
```

### Panel Using Filters
```apl
declare query_parameters (_country:string = "", _status:string = "");
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(1h) .. now())
| where isempty(_country) or ['geo.country'] == _country
| where isempty(_status) or tostring(status) == _status
| summarize count() by bin_auto(_time)
```

### Dependent City Filter (depends on country)
```apl
declare query_parameters (_country:string = "");
['http-logs']
| where _time between (ago(1h) .. now())
| where isnotempty(['geo.country']) and isnotempty(['geo.city'])
| where ['geo.country'] == _country
| distinct ['geo.city']
| project key=['geo.city'], value=['geo.city']
| sort by key asc
```

### Dataset Selector Filter
For multi-dataset dashboards, let users choose which dataset to view:
```apl
declare query_parameters (_dataset:string = "http-logs");
table(_dataset)
| where _time between (ago(1h) .. now())
| summarize count() by bin_auto(_time)
```

# V10 Migration Status

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

Starting proper migration following v10 HTML structure exactly.

## Backups
- Original broken attempt: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx.backup-broken`
- Original from git: `/tmp/original_landing.tsx`

## Migration Approach
Complete rewrite following v10's structure:
1. Import v10 fonts (IBM Plex Sans, Mono, Arabic)
2. Add v10 CSS variables and animations
3. Implement sections one by one
4. Test each section before moving to next

## Sections Status
- [ ] Setup (fonts, CSS variables, animations)
- [ ] Hero (with gold gradient, brand box)

- [ ] Claims (vertical list)
- [ ] Promise (3D carousel + personas)
- [ ] Platform (3D carousel + mockups)
- [ ] Architecture (flippable pyramid)

## Next Steps

2. Implement sections sequentially
3. Test each section visually

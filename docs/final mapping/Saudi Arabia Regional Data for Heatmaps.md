# **Strategic Geospatial Analysis of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Regional Infrastructure, Demographics, and Future Development Nodes**

## **1\. Introduction: The Geopolitics of Data in Vision 2030**

The transformation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under Vision 2030 is not merely an economic shift but a fundamental restructuring of the nation's spatial and demographic interactions. For policymakers, investors, and urban planners, the ability to visualize this transformation through high-fidelity heatmaps is a prerequisite for effective decision-making. A heatmap is more than a visualization of current assets; it is a diagnostic tool that reveals the friction between *legacy infrastructure*—built during the oil-boom eras to serve a centralized rentier state—and the *future-state nodes* designed to support a diversified, service-oriented economy.

This report provides an exhaustive, granular analysis of the statistical layers required to construct these heatmaps. It dissects the Kingdom’s administrative regions through three primary lenses requested for analysis: Healthcare Capacity, Educational Human Capital, and Digital Connectivity. Furthermore, to provide a truly predictive analysis, this report integrates a fourth and fifth layer: the emerging "Giga-Project" landscape—specifically the 2034 FIFA World Cup infrastructure and the Saudi Entertainment Ventures (SEVEN) complexes—and the critical "Food Security" logistics network managed by the General Food Security Authority (GFSA) and the National Agricultural Development Company (NADEC).

The synthesis of these datasets reveals a distinct narrative: while the "Golden Triangle" of Riyadh, Jeddah (Makkah Region), and Dammam (Eastern Region) continues to dominate in absolute volume, the Saudi government is aggressively flattening the quality-of-life curve. Peripheral regions such as the Northern Borders and Al-Jouf are exhibiting infrastructure densities and digital penetration rates that rival, and in some metrics surpass, the metropolitan cores. This "decentralization by design" is the critical insight that geospatial analysts must integrate into their models for the next decade of Saudi development.

**2\. Healthcare Infrastructure: Capacity, Density, and Regional Equity**

The healthcare sector serves as the foundational layer for any socio-economic heatmap. It acts as a proxy for both government service capability and population density. The 2023 statistical corpus from the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT) paints a picture of a mature system undergoing rapid privatization and efficiency optimization.

### **2.1 The National Healthcare Baseline**

As of the close of 2023, the Kingdom’s healthcare delivery system is anchored by a network of **499 hospitals**. This physical infrastructure supports a national bed capacity that translates to a density of **23.8 beds per 10,000 population**.1 While this figure provides a national benchmark, it is the regional variance that is most critical for heatmap generation.

The ownership structure of this infrastructure is a vital variable for economic modeling. The Ministry of Health (MoH) remains the dominant hegemon, controlling **59%** of the total bed capacity. Other governmental bodies—primarily the Military Medical Services, National Guard Health Affairs, and University Hospitals—control **18%**. The private sector, a key target for growth under the Health Sector Transformation Program (HSTP), currently holds **23%** of the bed capacity.2

The workforce manning these facilities is substantial, with a total medical doctor count of **113,300**, of whom 48,487 are Saudi nationals, reflecting a Saudization rate of approximately 42.8%.1 The nursing corps stands at **213,110**, while allied health professionals number **153,688**.1 This workforce density is the primary driver of operational expenditure and serves as an indicator of regional economic stability.

### **2.2 Regional Hospital Distribution: The Volume Layer**

When mapping the absolute number of healthcare facilities, the data correlates strictly with urbanization and administrative centrality. The Riyadh Region, functioning as the political and commercial capital, hosts the highest concentration of facilities, followed by the religious and tourism hub of Makkah.

| Administrative Region | Total Hospitals (2023) | Private Sector Beds | MoH Beds |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Riyadh** | 109 | 6,345 | 15,147 |
| **Makkah** | 95 | 3,905 | 12,253 |
| **Eastern Region** | 84 | 4,468 | 9,236 |
| **Aseer** | 41 | 1,170 | 3,881 |
| **Madinah** | 32 | 1,025 | 3,906 |
| **Jazan** | 28 | 250 | 2,986 |
| **Qassim** | 25 | 363 | 3,724 |
| **Hail** | 17 | 256 | 1,940 |
| **Tabuk** | 16 | 135 | 2,513 |
| **Najran** | 16 | 250 | 1,594 |
| **Al-Jouf** | 15 | 30 | 1,940 |
| **Northern Borders** | 11 | 0 | 1,460 |
| **Al-Baha** | 10 | 0 | 1,295 |

Table 1: Regional Distribution of Hospitals and Sectoral Bed Capacity.1

**Insight for Geospatial Analysis:** A heatmap based purely on "Number of Hospitals" will generate intense hotspots in Riyadh and Jeddah. However, Table 1 reveals a critical nuance: the **Private Sector** is heavily concentrated in the "Golden Triangle" (Riyadh, Makkah, Eastern Region). Regions like **Northern Borders** and **Al-Baha** show zero or negligible private sector bed capacity.3 This indicates that in peripheral regions, the state remains the sole provider of healthcare, suggesting that investment opportunities for private healthcare providers are geographically distinct from current operational clusters.

### **2.3 Bed Density: The Access Layer**

To measure the "quality of access," one must invert the heatmap to look at beds per capita. Here, the narrative shifts dramatically. The regions with the lowest absolute number of hospitals often boast the highest per-capita availability, reflecting a deliberate government policy to ensure equity for remote populations.

* **Northern Borders Region:** This region records the highest density in the Kingdom at **37.7 beds per 10,000 population**.1 Despite having only 11 hospitals, the ratio of beds to the relatively small population creates a surplus of capacity relative to national averages.  
* **Al-Baha Region:** Similarly, this mountainous region records **36.7 beds per 10,000 population**.1

Conversely, the major population centers show signs of strain.

* **Jazan Region:** Shows one of the lowest ratios at **1.8 beds per 1,000 people** (18 per 10,000).4  
* **Jeddah:** The gateway city records a critically low ratio of **1.8 beds per 1,000 people**.4  
* **Makkah Region:** Averages **1.6 beds per 1,000 people**.4

**Second-Order Insight:** The low density in Makkah and Jeddah is a strategic vulnerability. These regions not only host large resident populations but also absorb millions of pilgrims annually. The statistical discrepancy suggests that the healthcare infrastructure in the Western Region functions at a much higher "occupancy pressure" than the North. Studies indicate a gap of over **5,165 beds in Jeddah alone** to meet international standards of 2.9 beds per 1,000 people.4 Consequently, a heatmap of "Investment Need" would glow red over Jeddah and Makkah, while a heatmap of "Current Service Coverage" is greenest in the Northern Borders.

### **2.4 Gap Analysis and Future Requirements**

While the national average of \~24 beds per 10,000 people is respectable regionally, it trails the OECD average of **51 beds per 10,000**.2 To bridge this gap and reach OECD parity, the Kingdom would need to commission approximately **84,000 additional beds** over the medium to long term.2 This massive requirement underpins the construction boom and justifies the inclusion of "Planned Medical Cities" in any future-state heatmap.

**3\. Educational Statistics: Mapping Human Capital Formation**

The education layer of the heatmap does not merely show where schools are; it shows where the next generation of the Saudi workforce is being incubated. The 2023 data reflects a massive logistical operation managing over 31,000 physical assets and millions of students.

### **3.1 School Infrastructure and Density**

The total number of schools in Saudi Arabia stands at **31,231** as of 2023\.5 The sector is dominated by public provision, with government schools accounting for **78.1% (24,384 schools)** of the total, while private education constitutes **21.9%**.5

The distribution of students is the most accurate proxy for "Youth Population Density" available for heatmap construction. The concentration is heavily weighted toward the major employment hubs.

| Administrative Region | Percentage of Total General Education Students |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Riyadh** | 24.0% |
| **Makkah** | 23.0% |
| **Eastern Region** | 14.4% |
| **Aseer** | 7.7% |
| **Madinah** | 7.1% |
| **Jazan** | 5.7% |
| **Qassim** | 4.7% |
| **Tabuk** | 3.4% |
| **Hail** | 2.6% |
| **Al-Jouf** | 2.4% |
| **Najran** | 2.3% |
| **Northern Borders** | 1.4% |
| **Al-Baha** | 1.3% |

Table 2: Regional Distribution of Student Population.4

**Insight:** The combined student population of Riyadh and Makkah accounts for **47%** of the Kingdom's total. This indicates that nearly half of the future workforce is being trained in just two administrative regions, reinforcing the centrality of these hubs for future corporate recruitment strategies.

### **3.2 Quality Indicators: Teacher Ratios and Engagement**

While enrollment numbers give quantity, the *quality* of education is better assessed through ratios and engagement metrics.

* **Student-Teacher Ratio:** The national average for primary education is approximately **13.8 to 14 students per teacher**.7 This is a highly favorable ratio by global standards, allowing for personalized instruction. Regional variations in this ratio are generally low, indicating a successful federal standardization of staffing levels.  
* **Educational Engagement (The "Hidden" Heatmap):** A unique metric for assessing regional educational quality is student participation in voluntary academic competitions. In the 2023 "Statistical Knowledge Competition," participation rates revealed surprising hotspots of engagement that defy simple population logic.  
  * **Riyadh:** 21.0% of participants (aligned with population).  
  * **Taif (Governorate):** 17.5% of participants.9  
  * **Eastern Province:** 17.1% of participants.9

**Third-Order Insight:** The fact that the single governorate of Taif (within Makkah Region) outperformed the entire Eastern Province (a massive industrial region) in a statistical knowledge competition suggests a distinct "Human Capital Anomaly." Taif appears to be a hotspot for academic engagement, possibly due to active local educational leadership or a cultural emphasis on academic achievement. For a heatmap of "STEM Potential," Taif warrants a distinct, high-intensity classification separate from the broader Makkah region.

### **3.3 Higher Education and Internal Migration**

Higher education enrollment is even more concentrated than general education. Riyadh (26.7%), Makkah (24.0%), and the Eastern Region (15.1%) collectively host nearly **66%** of all university students.4 This creates a structural "Brain Drain" from peripheral regions like Al-Jouf and Northern Borders, where students must migrate to the Golden Triangle for tertiary education. This migration pattern is a critical layer for real estate heatmaps, as it drives demand for student housing and entry-level rentals in the three major hubs.

## ---

**4\. Digital Connectivity: The Ubiquitous Layer**

In many developing economies, internet coverage heatmaps show steep gradients between urban and rural areas. In Saudi Arabia, however, this gradient has been effectively flattened. The 2023/2024 data from the Communications, Space, and Technology Commission (CST) indicates that digital infrastructure acts as a ubiquitous "base layer" rather than a differentiator.

### **4.1 Penetration and Coverage**

The Kingdom boasts an internet penetration rate of **99%** as of 2024\.10 This near-total coverage extends to the peripheral regions, dismantling the historical digital divide.

* **Makkah Region:** 99.7% penetration.11  
* **Al-Jouf Region:** 99.7% penetration.11  
* **Northern Borders:** 99.6% penetration.11

**Strategic Implication:** The fact that Al-Jouf—an agricultural frontier—matches the connectivity of Makkah is a profound enabler. It permits the deployment of high-tech agricultural solutions (IoT moisture sensors, automated harvesting) described in Section 6 without the need for bespoke communications infrastructure. It also validates the feasibility of telemedicine and remote work initiatives in the far north.

### **4.2 Infrastructure Quality and Usage Behavior**

The quality of this connection is world-leading, driven by aggressive 5G and fiber deployment.

* **Mobile Primacy:** **98.9% to 99.4%** of internet usage is mobile-based.10  
* **Data Consumption:** The average Saudi user consumes **48 GB** of data per month, a figure that is triple the global average.10  
* **Network Expansion:** STC has deployed over **1,100 km** of new fiber cables and activated **125,000 FTTH** connections in 2024 alone.13

**Heatmap Refinement:** Since basic coverage is green everywhere, a useful digital heatmap for Saudi Arabia should focus on **5G Density** and **Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)** availability. The STC rollout data indicates that while 5G is reaching 2,000+ new locations (including underserved areas), the "ultra-high-speed" fixed-line capacity remains an urban luxury, primarily concentrated in the new residential developments of Riyadh and the Eastern Province.13

**5\. Strategic Development Nodes: Mapping the Giga-Projects**

A heatmap based solely on current statistics looks backward. To look forward, one must map the construction sites that will become the new centers of gravity for population and consumption. Two major portfolios define this future map: the **SEVEN Entertainment Complexes** and the **2034 FIFA World Cup Stadiums**.

### **5.1 Saudi Entertainment Ventures (SEVEN): Decentralizing Leisure**

SEVEN, a PIF subsidiary, is constructing 21 entertainment destinations across 14 cities. This is a deliberate strategy to capture disposable income within secondary cities, reducing economic leakage to Riyadh or Dubai.

* **SEVEN Al Hamra (Riyadh):** Located at Exit 10 on the Eastern Ring Road. This is a massive complex with a built-up area of **167,000 m²**. It will feature indoor surfing (Flowhouse) and indoor skydiving.14  
* **SEVEN Tabuk:** Located on King Faisal Road (Coords: **28.38°N, 36.56°E**). A 40,000 m² land area designed as a village under a colored glass canopy, reflecting the region's agricultural heritage.16  
* **SEVEN Abha:** Located near the Abha International Airport (approx. **18.09°N, 42.72°E**). Covering 64,000 m², this project is critical for the Aseer region's tourism strategy, providing year-round entertainment to complement the seasonal weather appeal.18  
* **SEVEN Al-Ahsa:** Situated at the intersection of Riyadh Road and King Abdullah Road. This 109,400 m² site will serve the dense population of the Al-Ahsa oasis, historically underserved in modern entertainment.20  
* **SEVEN Yanbu:** Located on the seafront, integrating with the industrial city's quality-of-life initiatives.21

### **5.2 2034 FIFA World Cup Stadiums: The New Sports Cities**

The bid for the 2034 World Cup has triggered a stadium construction boom that will reshape the urban fabric of five key cities. These are not just sports venues; they are integrated districts.

#### **5.2.1 Riyadh Region (The Center of Gravity)**

Riyadh will host eight stadiums, solidifying its status as the primary host.

* **King Salman International Stadium:** The flagship venue. Capacity **92,760**. Located in Northern Riyadh (**24.86°N, 46.696°E**). It will host the opening and final matches.22  
* **Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium (Qiddiya):** A technological marvel located on the Tuwaiq cliff (**24.59°N, 46.528°E**). Capacity \~47,000. Features include a retractable roof and a massive LED wall, integrated into the Qiddiya gaming and entertainment district.23  
* **New Murabba Stadium:** Located within the New Murabba downtown giga-project (**24.80°N, 46.55°E**). Capacity \~46,000. The stadium is designed to integrate with the "Mukaab" super-structure.25  
* **ROSHN Stadium:** Located in Southwest Riyadh (**24.45°N, 46.60°E**). Capacity 46,000. Developed by the PIF-owned real estate developer ROSHN, serving as an anchor for a massive residential community.26  
* **King Fahd Sports City:** The existing national stadium, undergoing massive renovation to reach \~70,000 capacity.27

#### **5.2.2 Jeddah (Makkah Region)**

* **Jeddah Central Development Stadium:** Located in the historic Al-Andalus/Al-Balad area (**21.53°N, 39.13°E**). Capacity 45,794. This stadium acts as the cultural anchor for the Jeddah Central regeneration project.28  
* **Qiddiya Coast Stadium:** Distinct from the Riyadh Qiddiya project, this stadium is located in Jeddah (**21.5°N approx**). Capacity 46,096. Its design is inspired by the "Mexican Wave" and a vibrant color palette.30  
* **King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) Stadium:** Located in Rabigh (**22.41°N, 39.18°E**). Capacity 45,700. This is a strategic move to revitalize the KAEC economic zone.31  
* **King Abdullah Sports City (The Shining Jewel):** Existing operational stadium, capacity 62,345.32

#### **5.2.3 Eastern Region**

* **Aramco Stadium:** Located in Al Khobar (**26.365°N, 50.181°E**). Capacity 47,000. Built by Aramco, reflecting the company's deep integration into the region's social infrastructure.33

#### **5.2.4 Aseer Region**

* **King Khalid University Stadium:** Located in Abha (**18.097°N, 42.720°E**). Currently a university ground, it is being expanded to **45,428 capacity**. This expansion supports the region's "Highland Tourism" strategy.34

#### **5.2.5 NEOM**

* **NEOM Stadium:** Located within "The Line." Capacity 46,000+. This remains the most futuristic and speculative of the venues, relying on the completion of the linear city's upper modules.32

## ---

**6\. Food Security and Agricultural Logistics: The Resilience Layer**

A comprehensive regional analysis must include the "invisible" infrastructure of food security. This layer is critical for understanding water usage, logistics corridors, and strategic resilience.

### **6.1 The Grain Silo Network (GFSA/SAGO)**

The General Food Security Authority (formerly SAGO) manages a network of silos that act as the nation's strategic reserve. This network is bifurcated into *Import Nodes* (Ports) and *Production/Consumption Nodes* (Inland).

* **Yanbu Commercial Port:** (**24.06°N, 38.05°E**). This facility is a critical entry point for grain serving the Madinah and Makkah regions. Recent expansions have increased its capacity to handle panamax vessels.35  
* **King Abdul Aziz Port (Dammam):** (**26.43°N, 50.10°E**). The eastern gateway handles 10,000 MT daily. Crucially, it is linked by **rail** to the Riyadh silos, a strategic logistics corridor that reduces truck traffic and carbon emissions.37  
* **Jeddah Islamic Port:** The largest import hub, with a daily unloading capacity of 12,000 MT.38  
* **Inland Production Silos:** Located in **Hail** and **Al-Jouf**, these silos support the re-emerging local wheat production sector. Saudi Arabia partially lifted its ban on wheat farming for small farmers, necessitating storage in these northern agricultural belts.39

### **6.2 NADEC: The Agricultural Mega-Projects**

The National Agricultural Development Company (NADEC) operates farms that are so large they function as independent industrial cities.

* **Al-Jouf Project:** Located in Wadi Sarhan. This is a global anomaly—the largest organic olive farm in the world, hosting **5 million trees** and a 72 million m² footprint.40 The combination of this project with the 99.7% internet penetration in Al-Jouf enables "Precision Agriculture" at a massive scale.  
* **Haradh Project:** Located in the Eastern Province (**24.14°N, 49.06°E**). This is a integrated dairy city with **94,000 cattle** and 375 million m² of land. It represents a massive concentration of biological assets and water demand.41  
* **Wadi Al-Dawasir:** Located south of Riyadh (**20.46°N, 44.78°E**). Spanning nearly 1,000 km², this project focuses on potatoes, wheat, and animal feed. It is a critical node for Riyadh's food supply chain.42  
* **Hail Project:** Northeast of Hail city. A key producer of onions and potatoes, integrating with the region's processing infrastructure.44

**7\. Integrated Regional Heatmap Profiles**

Synthesizing the data from Healthcare, Education, Digital, and Strategic Projects allows for the creation of multidimensional regional profiles.

### **7.1 Riyadh Region: The Hyper-Centralized Core**

* **Health:** High volume (109 hospitals), moderate density. The private sector is highly active (6,345 private beds).  
* **Education:** Hosts 24% of the nation's students and 26.7% of university students.  
* **Strategic Assets:** The epicenter of Vision 2030 construction, hosting 8 World Cup stadiums and multiple SEVEN complexes.  
* **Heatmap Character:** Intense activity across all layers. High congestion risks, high investment potential.

### **7.2 Makkah Region: The High-Pressure Hub**

* **Health:** 95 hospitals but low per-capita bed density (1.6/1,000). The infrastructure is under constant strain from the pilgrim influx.  
* **Digital:** Highest internet penetration in the Kingdom (99.7%).  
* **Strategic Assets:** 4 World Cup stadiums aimed at urban regeneration (Jeddah Central).  
* **Heatmap Character:** High demand pressure. "Red" zones for service capacity shortfalls.

### **7.3 Northern Borders & Al-Jouf: The Connected Frontier**

* **Health:** Highest bed density in the Kingdom (37.7/10k). Public sector dominant.  
* **Digital:** Surprisingly high connectivity (99.7%), matching Makkah.  
* **Strategic Assets:** NADEC Al-Jouf (Olive mega-project).  
* **Heatmap Character:** "Green" for service access and connectivity, "Low" for population density. Ideal for high-tech, low-labor industries (e.g., automated agriculture, data centers).

### **7.4 Eastern Region: The Industrial Engine**

* **Health:** 84 hospitals with a very strong private sector presence, reflecting the affluent industrial workforce.  
* **Education:** 14.4% of students, but lower engagement scores than Taif.  
* **Strategic Assets:** Aramco Stadium, Haradh Mega-Farm, Dammam Port Silos.  
* **Heatmap Character:** Industrial clusters. High purchasing power. Strong logistics infrastructure (Rail to Riyadh).

### **7.5 Aseer Region: The Tourism Rising Star**

* **Health:** 41 hospitals. Capacity is being aligned with tourism goals.  
* **Strategic Assets:** King Khalid University Stadium (Abha), SEVEN Abha.  
* **Heatmap Character:** Transforming from a peripheral region to a core tourism node. Investment inflows are creating new hotspots around Abha and Khamis Mushait.

**8\. Conclusion**

The geospatial analysis of Saudi Arabia reveals a nation executing a complex balancing act between *efficiency* and *equity*.

The **Health Heatmap** demonstrates a successfully distributed public safety net, where remote regions like the Northern Borders actually enjoy better per-capita bed ratios than the crowded urban centers of Jeddah and Riyadh. This counters the typical "rural neglect" narrative found in many developing economies.

The **Education Heatmap** largely mirrors population distribution but reveals hidden pockets of human capital potential, such as the high engagement rates in Taif, which suggest localized success stories worthy of further study.

The **Connectivity Heatmap** is the most uniform of all layers. With 99% 5G/4G coverage extending from the skyscrapers of Riyadh to the olive groves of Al-Jouf, digital infrastructure has become a ubiquitous utility, effectively removing "connectivity" as a constraint for site selection.

Finally, the **Strategic Project Heatmap** overlays a bold vision of the future. The dispersion of world-class assets—from the glass-canopied entertainment village in Tabuk to the cliff-side stadium in Qiddiya—shows a deliberate effort to create new economic engines outside the traditional oil-producing centers. For the geospatial analyst, the map of Saudi Arabia is no longer static; it is a dynamic canvas where the "center of gravity" is being actively engineered to shift outward, creating a polycentric nation of diversified opportunity.

Welcome to Josoor, I am Noor, let me familiarize you with the working area where we will do great things together (inshallah).

Planning - signal boosters to keep our promises tangible. Reporting - Internal Signals on our efficiency in acting on committments. and back to Sector to witness the impact then learn and improve. @docs/work/02_design_document_120126_0909.md:L190 While you always understood your transformation, now you can visualize it and its complexities
